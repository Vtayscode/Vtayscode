## Hi there
I'm Vincent and here's a little more about me:
- I'm studying Mechanical Engineering at the University of Cincinnati
- I am using GitHub so I can become more comfortable with code/software... especially the terminology!
- I am a huge fan of all things motorsports and my dream is to work in F1, WEC, or WRC.

Here is a list (kind of up-to-date) of the coding languages I know and how practiced I am with them:
| Rank | Language | Experience Level |
|-----:|----------|------------------|
|     1| Matlab   | Intermediate     |
|     2| Python   | Beginner         |
|     3| VBA      | Beginner         |
